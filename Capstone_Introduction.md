# Using Foursquare venues data to deduce predominant ethnic composition of New Yourk City neighborhoods

In contemporary interconnected world, big cities population include people of diverse ethnic origins. They live together, work together, and intermingle on daily basis. However, quite often people of particular ethnic backgrounds tend to prefer particular neighborhoods. You can find Chinatown, Little Italy or something similar practically in any big city in America.

Knowing predominant ethnic composition of the neighborhood may help businesses and government agencies to allocate resources to better serve particular area of the city. For example, post office in predominantly Latino neighborhood may employ more Spanish speakers and stock more forms and materials in Spanish than in the neighborhood with mostly Asian population. Grocery chains may carry more tortillas in one area and more pasta sauce and olive oil in the other.
